    "Imagine you are a stastician working for Western Allies during War World II, and your most important task is to estimate how many Panzer V tanks were made from a specific factory everyday. Based on the intelligence, your only information is that a typical tank factory can produce less than 200 tanks per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only helpful information you have is the serial number from the captured tanks. We already know that the German tank will be produced from serial number 1 to N based on its daily production rate. If we capture a tank with serial number 43, we know this is the 43rd tank the factory made at some day. Because every data you collect (capture one tank) is very expensive, you have to make the best out of every data point. Bayesian inference seems to be the best tool in this scenario. \n",
